# Stories behind these codes
- I wrote these code in my first and second year in the uni during 2014-2016.
- I started to do programming in 2014 September, the first year of my bachelor degree.
- My major is Software Engineering. The reasons that I chose it are two-fold, 1) I have confidence in my math; 2) My sister told me that knowing programming helps to get higher salary when you get a job (I don't know how she knew it, I was just impressed and kept that in mind).
- In China, the first programming language for uni student is c, different from here in Australia(Python).
- I knew nothing about the idea of programming when I first studied c in semester one, it frastrated me a lot, I got a relatively low score for the mid semester exam, I was so disappointed in myself.
- After the great failure in the exam, I started to study very hard. Stayed up late each day to do the PAT (Programming Ability Test). Some of the codes here were written during that time. 
- I achieved very high score in the c final exam that makes me feel confident about myself again, that success brought profound significance to me.
- Now I wanna say, choosing software engineering for uni is one of the most correct decisions I ever made.
